    <h4>Design Inspiration</h4>
    <p>
      The general design aesthetic of this Health Record is inspired by the Corning Day Made of Glass video.  We're not implementing the UI exactly as shown in the video; but we find it a useful tool in create a shared vision regarding Card UI and establishing a design language around haptic interfaces, complex animations, near-field communications between devices, and other advanced design concepts.
